# AI/ML Journey

Welcome to my **AI/ML** repository! This is where I document my journey into the world of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, starting from the basics and advancing toward more complex projects. Each project in this repository reflects my progress, learnings, and experiments with AI/ML concepts, tools, and techniques.

---

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to:

- Track my progress in learning AI/ML.
- Showcase projects and solutions to real-world problems.
- Serve as a portfolio of my knowledge and skills.

---

## Projects

### 1. Titanic Dataset (First ML Model)

The Titanic Dataset project is my first step into building a Machine Learning model. This project involves:

- Manipulating the Titanic dataset using `Numpy` and `Pandas`.
- Visualizing key insights using `Seaborn`.
- Building and evaluating models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
